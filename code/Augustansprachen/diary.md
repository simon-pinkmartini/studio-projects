Manually created an Excel file from the archive of speech texts (it's not structured well, cant be scrapedx)

# August 7th, 2017
There is another archive (not only with presidents, but with all bundesr√§te)
https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/reden/reden-der-bundesraete.html
I manually scraped some speeches form 2015-17
There is now a single Excel file with more columns (functions, language, )

Things to look at
- Nomad
- Topic modeling
- latent dirichlet allocation
